      "q1": "How do I enroll in Quran courses at Al-Amal?",
      "a1": "Enrolling is simple! Browse our course catalog, select your desired Quran, Arabic, or Tajweed course, and click 'Enroll Now'. You'll need to create a student account (or log in if you already have one), complete the registration form with your details and preferred schedule, and choose your payment method. Once payment is confirmed, you'll receive a welcome email with your class schedule and instructor information.",
      "q2": "What age groups do you teach?",
      "a2": "Al-Amal Islamic Education Platform welcomes students of all ages! We offer specialized programs for children (ages 6-12), teenagers (ages 13-17), adults, and seniors. Each age group has tailored teaching methods and materials to ensure effective learning. For children under 18, we require parental consent during registration and provide parent access to monitor progress.",
      "q3": "Do you offer free trial lessons?",
      "a3": "Yes! We offer a complimentary 30-minute trial lesson for first-time students. This allows you to experience our teaching methodology, meet your potential instructor, assess the platform's technology, and determine if our approach suits your learning style. No payment information is required to book a trial lesson. Simply visit our 'Book Trial Session' page and select your preferred time.",
      "q4": "What are the class timings and schedule flexibility?",
      "a4": "We understand that students have varying schedules, so we offer flexible class timings across multiple time zones. Classes are available 7 days a week from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM (your local time). You can choose between one-on-one sessions or group classes, with the option to select morning, afternoon, or evening slots. Our scheduling system allows you to book classes at your convenience and reschedule with 24-hour advance notice.",
      "q5": "Do you provide certificates upon course completion?",
      "a5": "Absolutely! Upon successful completion of any course, you will receive an official Al-Amal Islamic Education certificate. Our certificates are recognized and valued in Islamic educational communities worldwide. They include your name, course title, completion date, instructor signature, and a unique verification code. Advanced courses also include performance grades and detailed skill assessments.",
      "q6": "Can I learn at my own pace or are classes scheduled?",
      "a6": "We offer both options! Our Live Scheduled Classes provide real-time interaction with instructors at fixed times each week, perfect for students who thrive with structure and peer interaction. Our Self-Paced Learning option allows you to access pre-recorded lessons, study materials, and practice exercises anytime, ideal for busy schedules. You can also combine both approaches with our Hybrid Learning model.",
      "q7": "What technology or equipment do I need for online classes?",
      "a7": "To join our online classes, you'll need: a stable internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps recommended), a computer, tablet, or smartphone, a webcam and microphone (built-in or external), and the Zoom application (free to download). For Quran reading classes, we recommend having a physical Quran or access to a digital Quran app. Headphones are recommended for better audio quality during classes."
    },
    "courses": {
      "q1": "What Quran courses do you offer?",
      "a1": "We offer comprehensive Quran courses for all levels: Quran Reading for Beginners (Qaida & basic Arabic letters), Quran Recitation with Tajweed (proper pronunciation and rules), Quran Memorization Programs (Hifz with proven techniques), Quran Translation & Tafsir (understanding meanings and interpretation), and Advanced Qira'at Studies (different recitation styles). Each course is designed by qualified scholars and tailored to student abilities.",
      "q2": "How are Arabic language levels structured?",
      "a2": "Our Arabic language program follows a structured progression: Level 1 - Beginner (Arabic alphabet, basic vocabulary, simple sentences), Level 2 - Elementary (grammar foundations, everyday conversations, reading short texts), Level 3 - Intermediate (advanced grammar, writing skills, classical text comprehension), Level 4 - Advanced (fluent conversation, literature study, Quranic Arabic mastery). Students take a placement test to determine their starting level.",
      "q3": "What is Tajweed and why is it important?",
      "a3": "Tajweed is the set of rules governing the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Quran. It's essential because the Quran was revealed with specific phonetic characteristics, and learning Tajweed ensures you recite it correctly, as intended by Allah. Proper Tajweed preserves the meanings of words (incorrect pronunciation can change meanings), beautifies your recitation, and fulfills the obligation to read the Quran properly. Our Tajweed courses cover all fundamental and advanced rules with practical application.",
      "q4": "How long does it take to complete a course?",
      "a4": "Course duration varies by program and your learning pace: Basic Quran Reading: 3-6 months, Tajweed Fundamentals: 4-8 months, Quran Memorization (Juz Amma): 6-12 months, Complete Quran Memorization: 2-4 years, Arabic Language (one level): 6-9 months, Tafsir Studies: 12-18 months. These are average timelines; your actual completion time depends on class frequency, practice commitment, and individual learning speed.",
      "q5": "Do you offer one-on-one or group classes?",
      "a5": "We offer both formats to suit different learning preferences and budgets. One-on-One Classes provide personalized attention, flexible scheduling, customized learning pace, and direct instructor interaction (ideal for memorization and advanced studies). Group Classes (max 5-6 students) offer peer learning opportunities, collaborative exercises, lower cost, and scheduled class times. Both formats feature qualified instructors and comprehensive curriculum.",
      "q6": "Can I switch between courses or change my learning path?",
      "a6": "Yes, you have complete flexibility! Students can switch courses, add supplementary courses, adjust learning pace, or change from group to private classes at any time. Simply contact our academic advisor through your student dashboard, and they'll guide you through the transition process. If you've already paid for a course, we'll apply the remaining balance to your new course selection according to our transfer policy."
    },
    "enrollment": {
      "q1": "How do I create a student account?",
      "a1": "Creating an account is quick and easy! Click 'Sign Up' in the top navigation, fill in your basic information (name, email, password), verify your email address through the confirmation link we send, complete your student profile with learning goals and preferences, and select your time zone for accurate scheduling. For students under 18, a parent or guardian must complete the registration and provide consent.",
      "q2": "Is parental consent required for minors?",
      "a2": "Yes, for all students under 18 years of age, we require parental or guardian consent before enrollment. The parent/guardian must: create the student account using their own email, provide their contact information for communications, review and accept our Student Safety Policy and Code of Conduct, and authorize payment for course fees. Parents receive full access to monitor their child's progress, attendance, and communication with instructors.",
      "q3": "How do I select my instructor?",
      "a3": "We offer two options for instructor selection. In our Instructor Matching System, you complete a brief questionnaire about your learning style, goals, and preferences, and our system recommends the best-matched instructors. You can review their profiles, qualifications, teaching specialties, student reviews, and sample lesson videos. Alternatively, you can Browse All Instructors in our directory, watch introduction videos, read detailed biographies, check availability calendars, and directly request your preferred instructor. If you're not satisfied after the first class, you can request a different instructor at no cost.",
      "q4": "Can I change my schedule after enrollment?",
      "a4": "Yes, we understand that schedules can change. You can modify your class schedule through your student dashboard with 24-hour advance notice (without penalty), request temporary schedule holds for up to 4 weeks (for vacations or emergencies), permanently change your regular class times, or switch from morning to evening slots (subject to instructor availability). Frequent last-minute changes may be subject to our rescheduling policy, so we encourage planning ahead.",
